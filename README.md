Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## How To Play

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

### !["Screenshot of URLS page"](https://github.com/saintsappho/-tinyApp/tree/master/docs/empty_index.png)

### Although no links are visible, This does not prevent you from visiting  
### links in the database via longURL or the shortened URL. Please try to 
### visit the following link.
### http://localhost:8080/u/b2xVn2

### Now that you are logged in and staring at an empty index, please select 
### "Create New URL" from the nav bar. 
### You should see a simple text input box. Please enter your full URL, 
### including http:// or https:// as needed. 

### !["Screenshot of new URL page"](https://github.com/saintsappho/-tinyApp/tree/master/docs/create_new.png)

### The tinyUrl will be randomly generated and assigned to your URL, and you 
### will be redirected to the URLS homepage, where your new URLs will be on 
### display. You and only you will be able to see and edit them while logged ##in.

### Please play around with logging out and trying to cheat the system. 
### I believe i have plugged most of the holes. i am quite proud of this app.
